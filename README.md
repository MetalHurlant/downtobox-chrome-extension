Allow to Dl from Uptobox.

#### Work in progress!!!

#####Use:
Load it as unpacked extension for chrome (see google)

Go in extension's options to see the App.

Add a serie and click on download and don't close the option tab.

#####Issues:
- credential tabs: useless you'll need to connect via browser (extension get the opened session)
- need to put links and names in the same add/edit since if you reopen the modal everything appear on the same line
- need to be more robust !!!!!!! -> tests will help
- lake of options (need a new tab)

#####Future work (when issues will be fixed):
- popup is lame (use it for something or delete it)
- add a page with buttons to launch episodes
- test on non-premium account if it works
- use a framework like Ember?
